# Automated Elevator Overload Detector

The Automated Elevator Overload Detector is a vital component of elevator systems, designed to enhance passenger safety, optimize elevator performance, and improve overall building functionality. This repository contains the necessary code and documentation to understand, implement, and utilize this crucial feature.

## Features

- **Overload Detection**: The detector employs advanced sensors to accurately identify when an elevator is carrying an excessive load. It continuously monitors the weight inside the elevator and promptly detects any overload situations.

- **Real-time Alerts**: Once an overload is detected, the system generates real-time alerts, notifying both the elevator occupants and the building management. These alerts can be transmitted through various communication channels, such as audible alarms, visual indicators, or notifications to a centralized monitoring system.

- **Passenger Safety**: By promptly detecting overloads, the detector ensures the safety of elevator passengers. It prevents situations where the elevator exceeds its weight capacity, reducing the risk of accidents, malfunctions, or breakdowns that could endanger occupants.

- **Elevator Performance Optimization**: The overload detector plays a crucial role in optimizing elevator performance. By preventing excessive loads, it helps maintain the elevator within its operational limits, reducing wear and tear on mechanical components and improving the overall lifespan of the elevator.

- **Building Functionality**: Integrating the automated overload detector into a building's elevator system enhances its overall functionality. It provides a reliable mechanism for monitoring and managing elevator loads, allowing building management to make informed decisions about maintenance schedules, capacity planning, and operational efficiency.
